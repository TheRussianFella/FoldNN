Simple system to predict secondary structure of proteins 
# Current state
Right now I have a trained model, that can 
predict 3 classes of folding 
(Alpha-strands, Beta-sheets and Coil) with 
accuracy of ~67%. 
Currently I work on a new version of the 
network for much more folding types and also 
I have plans of using additional inforamtion 
about translation of proteins.

# Stay tuned :)
